# **🚦  HTTP Status Codes: The Traffic Lights of the Web**

Status codes are the API's way of saying "Here's what happened with your request."

### **The Universal Pattern:**

* **2xx = Success** ✅ "All good!"
* **3xx = Redirect** ↪️ "Go look over there"
* **4xx = Client Error** 🚫 "You messed up"
* **5xx = Server Error** 💥 "We messed up"

---

## **✅ 2xx Success: "Mission Accomplished!"**

### **200 OK - The Universal Success**

**Restaurant:** "Here's your food, exactly as ordered"

**When you see it:** GET, PUT, PATCH requests succeeded

| GET /posts/42<br>Response: 200 OK<br>Body: { "id": 42, "title": "Hello World" }<br> |
| :---- |

---

### **201 Created - "Successfully Made!"**

**Restaurant:** "Your order is placed and here's your receipt number"

**When you see it:** POST request successfully created something

| POST /posts<br>Response: 201 Created<br>Location: /posts/43<br>Body: { "id": 43, "title": "New Post" } |
| :---- |

**Key insight:** Often includes a `Location` header pointing to the new resource!

---

### **204 No Content - "Done, But Nothing to Show"**

**Restaurant:** "Your order is cancelled" (no food to bring back)

**When you see it:** DELETE succeeded, or update with no content to return

| DELETE /posts/42<br>Response: 204 No Content<br>(empty body) |
| :---- |

---

## **↪️ 3xx Redirects: "Not Here, Try There"**

### **301 Moved Permanently - "We've Moved!"**

**Restaurant:** "We permanently moved to a new location"

**Real-world:** A company changes their website address

| GET /old-blog<br>Response: 301 Moved Permanently<br>Location: /new-blog |
| :---- |

**Browser's reaction:** "I'll automatically go to the new location and remember this forever"

---

### **302 Found (Temporary Redirect)**

**Restaurant:** "We're temporarily serving from the food truck outside"

**Real-world:** Maintenance mode, temporary URL changes

| GET /posts<br>Response: 302 Found<br>Location: /maintenance |
| :---- |

**Browser's reaction:** "I'll go there now, but I'll try the original URL again next time"

---

### **304 Not Modified - "You Already Have This!"**

**Restaurant:** "Same menu as yesterday, no need to print a new one"

**Real-world:** Caching - you already have the latest version

| GET /posts/42<br>If-None-Match: "etag-12345"<br>Response: 304 Not Modified |
| :---- |

**Browser's reaction:** "Great! I'll use my cached version"

---

## **🚫 4xx Client Errors: "You Did Something Wrong"**

### **400 Bad Request - "I Don't Understand"**

**Restaurant:** "I can't understand your order"

**Real-world:** Malformed request, invalid JSON

POST /posts

| Body: { "title": }  ← Invalid JSON!<br>Response: 400 Bad Request<br>{ "error": "Invalid JSON syntax" } |
| :---- |

**Mental model:** Like ordering "one of the purple" - what are you asking for?

---

### **401 Unauthorized - "Who Are You?"**

**Restaurant:** "Show me your ID before I serve you alcohol"

**Real-world:** Missing or invalid authentication

| GET /admin/users<br>Response: 401 Unauthorized<br>{ "error": "Authentication required" } |
| :---- |

**Common confusion:** Despite the name, 401 means "NOT AUTHENTICATED" (you haven't identified yourself)

---

### **403 Forbidden - "I Know Who You Are, But You Can't Do This"**

**Restaurant:** "Sorry, this is the VIP section"

**Real-world:** Authenticated but lacking permissions

| DELETE /users/admin<br>Response: 403 Forbidden<br>{ "error": "Insufficient permissions" } |
| :---- |

**Key difference from 401:**

* 401: "I don't know who you are" → Log in
* 403: "I know who you are, but you're not allowed" → Tough luck

---

### **404 Not Found - "That Doesn't Exist"**

**Restaurant:** "We don't have that item on the menu"

**Real-world:** Resource doesn't exist

| GET /posts/999999<br>Response: 404 Not Found<br>{ "error": "Post not found" } |
| :---- |

**Most famous code on the internet!** Everyone's seen this.

---

### **409 Conflict - "That Creates a Problem"**

**Restaurant:** "You already have an order in progress"

**Real-world:** Duplicate resource, conflicting state

| POST /users<br>Body: { "email": "existing@email.com" }<br>Response: 409 Conflict<br>{ "error": "Email already exists" } |
| :---- |

---

### **429 Too Many Requests - "Slow Down!"**

**Restaurant:** "You're ordering too fast, give us a minute"

**Real-world:** Rate limiting

| GET /api/data (100th request in 1 minute)<br>Response: 429 Too Many Requests<br>Retry-After: 60<br>{ "error": "Rate limit exceeded" } |
| :---- |

---

## **💥 5xx Server Errors: "It's Not You, It's Us"**

### **500 Internal Server Error - "We Broke Something"**

**Restaurant:** "The kitchen caught fire"

**Real-world:** Unhandled exception, code crashed

| GET /posts<br>Response: 500 Internal Server Error<br>{ "error": "An unexpected error occurred" }<br> |
| :---- |

**What to do:** Not your fault! Report to developers, try again later.

---

### **502 Bad Gateway - "The Kitchen Isn't Responding"**

**Restaurant:** "Our supplier didn't deliver ingredients"

**Real-world:** Upstream service failed (database down, microservice timeout)

| GET /posts<br>Response: 502 Bad Gateway |
| :---- |

**Mental model:** Like a chain of dominoes - one service down affects others.

---

### **503 Service Unavailable - "We're Temporarily Closed"**

**Restaurant:** "Closed for maintenance"

| Real-world: Planned maintenance, overloaded server<br>GET /api/data<br>Response: 503 Service Unavailable<br>Retry-After: 3600 |
| :---- |

---

## **🎯 Status Code Decision Tree**

**Did the request succeed?** → YES: 2xx (200, 201, 204)

**NO → Did the client make a mistake?** → YES: 4xx

* Can't understand: 400
* Not logged in: 401
* Logged in but forbidden: 403
* Doesn't exist: 404
* Conflict: 409
* Too many requests: 429

**NO → Did the server make a mistake?** → YES: 5xx

* Server crashed: 500
* Upstream failed: 502
* Temporarily down: 503

## Key Takeaways

1. **Status codes communicate the result of an HTTP request** — they tell the client what happened without parsing the response body
2. **2xx means success** — 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content are the most common
3. **4xx means client error** — 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 429 Too Many Requests
4. **5xx means server error** — 500 Internal Server Error, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway Timeout
5. **Use the most specific status code available** — 409 Conflict is better than 400 Bad Request when a resource already exists
