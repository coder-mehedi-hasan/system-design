# Memory vs Disk

> RAM is 1,000x faster than SSD, but costs 30x more per GB — understanding this hierarchy is fundamental to designing cost-effective, high-performance systems.



## **💾 Memory vs Disk: The Speed Hierarchy**

### **The Kitchen Analogy**

We have already introduced this concept in the earlier section here is a bit detailed and elaborated part of the same concept

Let’s compare computer storage with something familiar: cooking in a kitchen.

Your Kitchen Layout:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Level 1: Your Hands (analogous to the CPU Registers)

- Currently holding a knife and onion

- Instant access (nanoseconds)

- Very limited (2 items)

Level 2: Countertop ( like the RAM)

- Ingredients you're actively using

- Very fast access (microseconds)

- Limited space (16GB worth)

- Loses everything when power off (volatile!)

Level 3: Kitchen Cabinets (SSD)

- Ingredients you use today

- Fast access (milliseconds)

- More space (1TB worth)

- Keeps everything when power off (persistent!)

Level 4: Garage Storage (HDD)

- Bulk items, rarely used ingredients

- Slower access (seconds)

- Lots of space (10TB worth)

- Persistent storage

Level 5: Storage Unit (Cloud/Tape)

- Things you barely use

- Very slow access (minutes/hours)

- Massive space (unlimited)

- Persistent, archived

The Pattern:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Closer \= Faster but Less Space

Farther \= Slower but More Space

Remember the storage diagram we discussed on the first section (the fundamentals of computing)? Storage latency ranges from nanoseconds (RAM) to milliseconds (disk) to seconds (network storage). This affects EVERY operation in your system!

### **RAM (Random Access Memory): The Speed King**

**What it actually is:**

Physical RAM Module:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

![img9](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762436766/48_wtkdft.png)

Characteristics:
- Random access (any address in same time)
- Volatile (loses data when power off!)
- VERY fast
- Limited capacity

**Speed Demonstration:**

RAM Access Time:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Reading 1 byte from RAM: \~100 nanoseconds

How fast is that?

If RAM access was 1 second:
- SSD access: 16 minutes
- HDD access: 2 hours
- Internet request: 4 months!

Real numbers:
- RAM: 100 ns (0.0001 ms)
- SSD: 0.1 ms (1,000x slower)
- HDD: 10 ms (100,000x slower)

**Real-World Example:**

**You’ll learn more about database queries and caching in future lessons but if you write code you could refer to these snippets below**

```js
 // Database Query Without Caching
const getUser = async (userId) => {
// Query database (on SSD)
  const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id \= ?',(userId))
    return user;
  }
  // Time: 50ms (database query)
  //If called 1000 times:
  // It takes50 seconds
  // Database Query With RAM Caching
  const userCache = new Map();
  // In RAM
  const getUserCached = async (userId) => {
  // Check RAM first
  if (userCache.has(userId)) {
    return userCache.get(userId); // From RAM
    // Not in cache, query database
    const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id \= ?',(userId)  );
    // Store in RAM for next time
    userCache.set(userId, user);
    return user;
    }

  // First call: 50ms (database)
  // Subsequent calls: 0.0001ms (RAM)
  // If called 1000 times: 50ms \+ (999 × 0.0001ms) \= 50ms\!
  // 1000x faster\! ⚡

  ```

**The Volatility Problem:**

What Happens When Power is Lost:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RAM (Volatile):
Power ON:  [Your data is here!]

Power OFF: [Everything GONE! ❌]

Power ON:  [Empty RAM, no data]

Disk (Persistent):
Power ON:  [Your data is here!]

Power OFF: [Data stays on disk ✓]

Power ON:  [Your data is still here! ✓]

This is why:
- You can't store databases ONLY in RAM

- Cache can disappear on restart

- Need to persist important data to disk

**RAM Usage Patterns:**

What Goes in RAM:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Active Process Memory

   - Running applications

   - Operating system

   - Currently executing code

2. Cache

   - Database query results

   - Frequently accessed data

   - Session data

3. Buffers

   - Data waiting to be written to disk

   - Network packet buffers

4. File System Cache

   - Recently accessed files

   - OS caches file contents

Monitoring RAM:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```bash
| $ free -h
total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   availableMem:
16Gi       8.2Gi       2.1Gi       200Mi     5.7Gi       7.5Gi

Used: 8.2GB (your applications)

Free: 2.1GB (unused)

Buff/cache: 5.7GB (OS caching files)

Available: 7.5GB (can be freed if needed)
```

### **SSD (Solid State Drive): The Modern Standard**

**What it actually is:**

How SSDs Work:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Flash Memory Cells:

![img10](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762436766/49_psldow.png)

No moving parts!

- Electronic (like RAM)

- Persistent (like HDD)

- Fast (almost like RAM)

Best of both worlds!

**Speed Profile:**

SSD Performance:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Random Read: 0.1ms (fast!)

Sequential Read: 500 MB/s (very fast!)

Random Write: 0.1ms

Sequential Write: 450 MB/s

IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):

Consumer SSD: 100,000 IOPS

Enterprise SSD: 500,000+ IOPS

This is why modern computers feel fast!

**Real-World Impact:**

Loading a Web Application:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HDD System:

1. Boot OS: 60 seconds

2. Load browser: 20 seconds

3. Start app: 15 seconds

Total: 95 seconds 😴

SSD System:

1. Boot OS: 10 seconds

2. Load browser: 2 seconds

3. Start app: 3 seconds

Total: 15 seconds ⚡

6x faster! This is why SSDs are standard now.

**Types of SSDs:**

SATA SSD (Consumer Grade):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Speed: 500 MB/s

Interface: SATA (same as old HDDs)

Cost: $0.10/GB

Use: Laptops, desktops

![img11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762436769/59_ietplb.png)

NVMe SSD (High Performance):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Speed: 3,500 MB/s (7x faster!)

Interface: PCIe (direct to CPU)

Cost: $0.15/GB

Use: Gaming PCs, servers, databases

![img12](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762436769/61_rx1nnr.png)

Cloud SSD (AWS gp3):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Speed: 3,000 IOPS baseline

Cost: $0.08/GB/month \+ IOPS

Use: Production databases, VMs

### **HDD (Hard Disk Drive): The Legacy Workhorse**

**What it actually is:**

Mechanical Hard Drive:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Physical Components:

    [Spinning Platter]

         │  7,200 RPM

         │

    [Read/Write Head]

         │  Moves across platter

Like a record player!

**Why HDDs are Slow:**

Lets look at the steps involved in reading data from HDD:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: Seek Time (5-10ms)
   Move the read head to correct track

   [Physical movement! Slow!]

Step 2: Rotational Latency (4ms average)
   Wait for platter to spin to right position

   [Mechanical! Must wait for rotation!]

Step 3: Transfer Time (0.1ms)
   Actually read the data

   [Finally! Data transfer!]

Total: \~10ms per operation

Compare to SSD: 0.1ms
HDD is 100x slower!

![img13](https://res.cloudinary.com/dretwg3dy/image/upload/v1762354300/32_yns27w.png)

Why Sequential is Better:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


Random reads (jumping around):

- Read block 100: Seek (10ms) \+ Read

- Read block 5000: Seek (10ms) \+ Read

- Read block 200: Seek (10ms) \+ Read

Total: 30ms for 3 blocks

Sequential reads (consecutive):

- Read block 100: Seek (10ms) \+ Read

- Read block 101: No seek! \+ Read

- Read block 102: No seek! \+ Read

Total: 10ms for 3 blocks

3x faster when sequential!

**Where HDDs Still Make Sense:**

HDD Advantages:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Cost

   HDD: $0.02/GB

   SSD: $0.10/GB

   5x cheaper!

2. Capacity

   HDD: 20TB drives available

   SSD: 8TB typical max

   More space!

3. Longevity for Archives

   HDD: Can last 10+ years sitting

   SSD: Can lose data after years unpowered

   Better for cold storage!

Good use cases:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Backups (sequential writes)

✓ Video surveillance (continuous write)

✓ Media archives (large files, rare access)

✓ Cold data storage

✓ Data warehouses (sequential scans)

Bad use cases:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Databases (random access)

❌ Operating system

❌ Virtual machines

❌ Active applications

❌ Anything needing low latency

## Key Takeaways

1. **RAM is 1,000x faster than SSD for random access** — but RAM is volatile and expensive ($3-5/GB vs $0.10/GB for SSD)
2. **SSDs have no moving parts and offer consistent low-latency reads** — ideal for databases and applications with random access patterns
3. **HDDs are cheapest per GB but have high seek times** — best for sequential workloads like log files and backups
4. **Databases use RAM for active data and disk for persistence** — buffer pools keep frequently accessed data in memory
