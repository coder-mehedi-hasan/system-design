# Computer Memory Hierarchy

> A hierarchy from nanosecond registers to multi-second tape — each layer trades speed for capacity, and understanding this shapes how you design caching, buffering, and storage.



## **💾 3: Memory Hierarchy - The Speed Pyramid**

You’ll learn more about storage in the “Storage Fundamentals”**section of the content in following

### **🎯 Challenge 3: The Library Problem**

**Scenario:** You're writing a research paper. Where do you keep your materials?

**Option A:**

Everything in your brain (instant recall, tiny capacity)

**Option B:**

Books on your desk (quick to grab, limited space)

**Option C:**

Books on your bookshelf (walk to get them, more space)

**Option D:**

Books in the library (drive to get them, unlimited space)

**Question:**

Which do you use?

**The Answer:**

ALL OF THEM! You use different storage based on frequency of access and size!

**This is exactly how computer memory works!**

### **🏃 Understanding the Speed Difference**

**Let's make these time scales relatable:**

LATENCY HUMANIZED:

If accessing a CPU register took 1 second:

L1 Cache:     3 seconds    (walk to next room)

L2 Cache:     14 seconds   (walk outside)

L3 Cache:     75 seconds   (drive to corner store)

RAM:          5 minutes    (drive across town)

SSD:          4 days       (fly to Europe)

HDD:          1 year       (travel to Saturn)

The difference is MASSIVE!

### **📚 Detailed Look at Each Level**

#### **Level 1: CPU Registers**

🎯 REGISTERS - The Brain's Scratchpad

Location: Inside the CPU itself

Size: \~16-32 registers × 64 bits \= 100-200 bytes

Speed: 0.3 nanoseconds (one CPU cycle)

What they hold:

├─ Currently executing instruction

├─ Temporary calculation results

├─ Memory addresses being accessed

└─ Program counter (what to do next

### **🎮 Interactive Journey: The Cache Hunt**

**Let's follow what happens when the CPU needs data:**

THE DATA RETRIEVAL JOURNEY

CPU needs value at memory address 0x1234:

Step 1: Check L1 Cache
────────────────────────
CPU: "Is address 0x1234 in L1?"
L1: "Checking... NO!" ❌
Time wasted: 1 nanosecond
Status: L1 CACHE MISS

Step 2: Check L2 Cache
────────────────────────
CPU: "Is address 0x1234 in L2?"
L2: "Checking... NO!" ❌
Time wasted: 3 nanoseconds (total: 4ns)
Status: L2 CACHE MISS

Step 3: Check L3 Cache
────────────────────────
CPU: "Is address 0x1234 in L3?"
L3: "Checking... NO!" ❌
Time wasted: 15 nanoseconds (total: 19ns)
Status: L3 CACHE MISS

Step 4: Check RAM
────────────────────────
CPU: "Is address 0x1234 in RAM?"
RAM: "Found it! Here's the value: 42" ✓
Time taken: 100 nanoseconds (total: 119ns)
Status: RAM HIT

Step 5: Update Caches (for next time)
────────────────────────
Copy value to L3: Address 0x1234 \= 42
Copy value to L2: Address 0x1234 \= 42
Copy value to L1: Address 0x1234 \= 42

Next time CPU needs 0x1234:
────────────────────────
CPU: "Is address 0x1234 in L1?"
L1: "YES! Value \= 42" ✓
Time taken: 1 nanosecond

119x faster the second time! 🚀

### **📊 Cache Hit Rates: Why They Matter**

CACHE PERFORMANCE

Typical cache hit rates:
L1 Cache: 95% hit rate
L2 Cache: 80% hit rate (of L1 misses)
L3 Cache: 70% hit rate (of L2 misses)

Example with 1000 memory accesses:

950 found in L1 (1 ns each)
  \= 950 ns

40 found in L2 (3 ns each)
  \= 120 ns

21 found in L3 (15 ns each)
  \= 315 ns

10 found in RAM (100 ns each)
  \= 1000 ns

Total: 2,385 ns for 1000 accesses
Average: 2.4 ns per access!

Without caches (all from RAM):
1000 × 100 ns \= 100,000 ns

CACHE MAKES IT 42x FASTER! 🚀

---

### **🚨 Common Misconception: "More Cache Always Better"**

**You might think:** "I want 1GB of L1 cache!"

**The Reality:** Cache size is a careful balance!

❌ WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE HUGE CACHES:

Problem 1: PHYSICAL SPACE

├─ Caches are on the CPU disk

├─ Disc size is limited

└─ Larger cache \= less room for cores

Problem 2: SPEED TRADEOFF

├─ Larger cache \= more area to search

├─ More area \= longer wires

└─ Longer wires \= SLOWER access!

Problem 3: COST
├─ Cache memory is extremely expensive
├─ L1 cache: $1000+ per MB!
└─ RAM: $5 per GB (200,000x cheaper!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ ACTUAL DESIGN:

Modern CPUs use optimal sizes:

L1: 32-64 KB (tiny but INSTANT)

L2: 256-512 KB (small but very fast)

L3: 8-64 MB (larger, shared, still fast)

RAM: 8-128 GB (huge, slower)

Each level is the sweet spot for its purpose!

**The Engineering Tradeoff:**

Hypothetical 1MB L1 Cache:

✓ More hits

✓ More data stored

✗ 10x slower access (defeats the purpose!)

✗ Takes up space for 2 CPU cores

✗ Costs thousands of dollars

Actual 32KB L1 Cache:

✓ Lightning fast (0.3ns)

✓ Affordable

✓ Small enough to keep close to core

✓ High enough hit rate (95%)

Result: Small but fast beats large but slow!

### **🎯 Memory Hierarchy Summary**

THE COMPLETE PICTURE:

Why this hierarchy exists:

🏃 FAST \+ SMALL \+ EXPENSIVE

   ↕️ Registers: Instant but microscopic

   ↕️ L1 Cache: Nearly instant, tiny

   ↕️ L2 Cache: Very fast, small

   ↕️ L3 Cache: Fast, medium

🐢 SLOW \+ LARGE \+ CHEAP

   ↕️ RAM: Decent, large

   ↕️ SSD: Slow, huge

   ↕️ HDD: Very slow, massive

The Principle: Keep frequently used data close!

LOCALITY OF REFERENCE:

Temporal locality:

"If I accessed this data, I'll likely access it again soon"
→ Keep recent data in cache

Spatial locality:

"If I accessed this data, I'll likely access nearby data"

→ Load whole cache lines (64 bytes at a time)

This is why caches work so well!

## Key Takeaways

1. **Memory forms a hierarchy trading speed for capacity** — registers > L1 cache > L2 cache > L3 cache > RAM > SSD > HDD
2. **RAM is volatile — data is lost when power is off** — this is why databases need write-ahead logs and checkpointing
3. **Cache locality matters for performance** — accessing data sequentially (spatial locality) or repeatedly (temporal locality) is dramatically faster
4. **Memory management is fundamental to system design** — understanding how memory works helps you reason about caching, buffering, and scaling
